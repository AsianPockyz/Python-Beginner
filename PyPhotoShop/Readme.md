# PyPhotoshop

A basic photo manipulator Python implementation of image filters

Use Python to adjust brightness and contrast, add blur, and detect edges!

image.py: contains the Image class that will read and write the images using the PNG Writer and Reader from Kylie Ying png.py: pure Python PNG Reader and Writer classes from Johann C. Rocholl transform.py: implemented image filter functions

Note that in class Image the input and output path will have to be modified for your own directory

i.e.,

    "C:/user/path/input" "C:/user/path/output"
    r"C:\user\path\input"
    "C:\user\path\input"

- image.py: contains the `Image` class that will read and write the images using the PNG `Writer` and `Reader` Created by Kylie Ying
- png.py: pure Python PNG `Reader` and `Writer` classes from Johann C. Rocholl
- transform.py: implemented image filter functions
