A basic photo manipulator 
Python implementation of image filters

Use Python to adjust brightness and contrast, add blur, and detect edges!

image.py: contains the Image class that will read and write the images using the PNG Writer and Reader from Kylie Ying
png.py: pure Python PNG Reader and Writer classes from Johann C. Rocholl
transform.py: implemented image filter functions

Note that in class Image the input and output path will have to be modified for your own directory

i.e., 
1. "C:/user/path/input" "C:/user/path/output"
2. r"C:\user\path\input" 
3. "C:\\user\\path\\input"
